# Work Session Logger
A tool to help log work sessions.

This is a tool that I wrote to help me track work hours. Each session consists of a start time and end time (rounded to 6 minute intervals), a message describing the session, and a billing category. The log is tracked in a csv file that I can then later import into an excel file for billing purposes.
